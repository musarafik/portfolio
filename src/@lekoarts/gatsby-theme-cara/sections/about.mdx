## About

I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. I am graduating this coming December with an interest in Software Engineering roles.

I have a great passion for technology, both in using it to solve problems and empowering others to learn how to use it. For example, I am a currently a mentor for SummerHacks, a 12-week long hackathon hosted by a student organization at UT called Freetail Hackers. I am also interested in web/mobile app development and have been pursuing my own projects to cultivate this passion further. In my free time, I enjoy discovering new hip-hop albums and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/moosetagraphy/).
