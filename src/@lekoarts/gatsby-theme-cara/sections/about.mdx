# About

I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. I am graduating this coming December and I am interested in Sotware Engineering roles.

I have a great passion for technology, both in using it and helping others to learn how to use it. Currently, I am a mentor for SummerHacks, a 12-week long hackathon hosted by a student organization at UT called Freetail Hackers.
